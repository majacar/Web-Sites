<p>Daenerys Targaryen</p>
<div>
Princess Daenerys Targaryen, known as Daenerys Stormborn[1] and the self-referential Dany,[1] is one of the last confirmed members of House Targaryen, along with her older brother Viserys, and she is one of the major POV characters in A Song of Ice and Fire. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Daenerys is played by Emilia Clarke.[13]
Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. She was named by her mother.[16] Daenerys was conceived during the last month of Robert's Rebellion, the war which ended House Targaryen's reign over the Seven Kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince Viserys to the family ancestral seat of Dragonstone to escape the coming Sack of King's Landing.
