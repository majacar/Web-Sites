<p>JOHN SNOW</p>

<div>
King Jon Snow is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. He is played by starring cast member Kit Harington, and debuts in the series premiere.

When Eddard Stark returned home from Robert's Rebellion he presented the infant Jon as his bastard son which he fathered while on campaign - never telling anyone, including Jon, who his mother was. Eddard made the unusual choice of raising Jon at his home castle Winterfell alongside his lawful children - causing tension with his beloved wife Catelyn Tully.

In truth, Jon was never Eddard's child at all but the secret son of his late sister, Lyanna Stark, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen of Dragonstone. This status as Prince Rhaegar's only surviving child potentially gives Jon a better claim to the Iron Throne than anyone else alive, including Daenerys Targaryen herself.
