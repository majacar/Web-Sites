<p>Melisandre - the Red Woman</p>
<div>
Melisandre, often referred to as the Red Woman, is a major character in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is played by starring cast member Carice van Houten and debuts in "The North Remembers." She is a Red Priestess in the religion of R'hllor, the Lord of Light and a close counselor to Stannis Baratheon in his campaign to take the Iron Throne.
Originally born a slave in Essos centuries ago, Melisandre is a Red Priestess of the Lord of Light, a deity that is not widely worshiped in Westeros. Hailing from Asshai, a country located in the far east of the continent of Essos, she claims to wield powerful magical abilities, particularly the power of prophecy. Melisandre wears a large ruby necklace that seems to glow whenever she performs her magic. Some years ago she crossed the Narrow Sea and came to the court of Lord Stannis Baratheon on the island stronghold of Dragonstone, to preach her faith. Stannis and the majority of his household have now converted to her religion, and she has become a close adviser to Stannis himself.[1]
