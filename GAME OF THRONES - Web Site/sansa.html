<p>SANSA STARK</p>

<div>
Princess Sansa Stark is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seasons. She is played by starring cast member Sophie Turner, and debuts in the series premiere. Sansa is the daughter of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and his wife Lady Catelyn, sister of Robb, Arya, Bran and Rickon Stark, and "half-sister" of Jon Snow. She initially starts off as a soppy, slightly petulant girl with a very naive idea of the world, but as time goes on and she and her family suffer one cruelty and betrayal after another, she becomes a more hardened and learned individual.
