<p>BRANDON STARK</p>

<div>
Brandon Stark, typically called Bran, is the second son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully. He is one of the major POV characters in the books. He has four older siblings—Robb, Jon, Sansa, Arya—and one younger—Rickon. Like his siblings, he is constantly accompanied by his direwolf, Summer, with whom he shares a strong warg connection.[3] He is seven years old at the beginning of A Game of Thrones. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones he is played by Isaac Hempstead-Wright.[4]
ran favors his mother Catelyn in appearance, having the thick auburn hair and deep blue eyes of the Tullys.[5][6]

Bran is a sweet and thoughtful boy, well-loved by everyone at Winterfell. He has a fascination with climbing and exploring along the walls and ramparts of the castle. Catelyn once jested that Bran could "climb before he could walk", however, his climbing often distresses her.[7] Like his siblings, he is also dutiful and tough-minded, as well as possessing a propensity for adventure and excitement. His half-brother Jon Snow fondly thinks to himself that Bran was always "stubborn and curious", and in like manner constantly wanted to join in the play of the older boys, believing himself an adult at seven.
